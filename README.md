## Code Structure
The game is implemented in the following files:  
- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that loads the game.  
- **`script.js`**: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic.  
- **`styles.css`**: The CSS file that styles the game.  

## Game Logic
The game logic is implemented in `script.js` and uses the following techniques:  
- Canvas API for rendering the game graphics  
- Event listeners for handling user input  
- Basic collision detection and response  

## Example Use Cases
- Play the game solo against the computer opponent.  
- Challenge a friend to a game by sharing the link to `index.html`.  

## Future Development
- Implement varying difficulty levels against PC.
- Implement multyplayer.
- Add sound effects and music to enhance the gameplay experience.  
- Create a high score tracker to record player progress.
